##In-house developer assessment

This is a competency based assessment and serves to determine the level of experience in the following: 

* PHP
* SQL
* CSS
* Javascript
* HTML

The ideal candidate will have sufficient knowledge of the required languages but must be able to navigate the MVC framework and rectify any bugs. Enhancements to the code that makes it more readable and easier to manage are welcome.

* You will need to following setup to complete this assessment (we advise the latest WAMP/LAMP/MAMP stack):
    * apache 2.4.9+
    * php 5.5.12+
    * mysql 5.6.17+

* Enable apache modules mod-rewrite
* The application is MVC and uses the above modules (via the .htaccess file) to route URL's to specific controllers and then actions.
* Once you have the webserver setup and cloned the application to your local working directory you will be provided with the rest of the instructions.
